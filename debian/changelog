libinput (0.2.0-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.
    + There is no API/ABI stability promise yet, but the API and ABI have
      been mostly stable so far. Since this is only in experimental at this
      point and there are no rdepends, I won't change the library name. That
      will change once there are rdepends or once the library is in unstable.
  * debian/copyright:
    + Updated copyright years.
  * debian/libinput0.symbols:
    + Updated for the new symbols.
